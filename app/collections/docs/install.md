# Installation

To install Hyperspan, you first need to [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) — a new fast JavaScript runtime with TypeScript support (and a lot more!) built in.

Once Bun is installed on your system, you can create a new Hyperspan app from the starter template:

```shell
bunx degit vlucas/hyperspan/packages/starter-template my-app
cd my-app
bun install
bun run dev
```

From there, you can add [custom routes](/docs/routes), [layouts](/docs/layouts), [vanilla JS](/docs/clientjs/vanilla), and [Preact/React components](/docs/clientjs/islands) to your app. The sky is the limit!
